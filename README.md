THE GOAL:
The main purpose I created this solo project is to test my skill in HTML & CSS that I've been learned.

1. Created 3 section (hero-section, activity-section, guide-section). Each section can contains div, img, h1-h4, or p tags.
2. Centering a div tag
3. Applying background image
4. Wrapping every single one of the 3 section with a div
5. Using id and classes selector for styling purposes
6. Using utility classes
7. Using flexbox

FINAL RESULT:
